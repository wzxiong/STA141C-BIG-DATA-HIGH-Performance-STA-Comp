## STA 141C Big Data & High Performance Statistical Computing 

### Course description 

This course explores aspects of scaling statistical computing for large data and simulations. It will cover (1) How to write a good program for analyzing data, (2) Data-intensive computing for statistical models, and (3) How to parallelize the code for handling big data. The goal is to learn practical techniques to efficiently handle real world data mining tasks and competitions.
